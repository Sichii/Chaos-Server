# MetaData

When a client logs into the game, one of the first things it does is request the server's metadata. There are various
kinds of metadata and
each kind will be detailed below. Generation of metadata is handled by
the [MetaDataStore](<xref:Chaos.Services.Storage.MetaDataStore>) class. Configuration for this class can be specified
via `Options:MetaDataStoreOptions`.

## MetaDataCacheOptions

The `MetaDataStoreOptions` class contains configuration for the `MetaDataStore` class. The following properties are
available:  
[!code-csharp[](../../Chaos/Services/Storage/Options/MetaDataStoreOptions.cs)]

### Mutators

Mutators are used to modify item metadata before it is finalized. For example, if you implement a system in your server
for enchanting items, the enchanted items would not be completely new items. You could achieve those enchantments by
setting the values on Item.cs and letting them serialize as overrides to the template values. To have these items show
up in metadata, you would create a mutator that simulates enchantments through non-destructive mutation of an item meta
node.

Implement your own mutator as implementations of
the [IItemMetaNodeMutator](<xref:Chaos.MetaData.Abstractions.IItemMetaNodeMutator>) interface and add it to
the `MetaDataStoreOptions` via the `Chaos.Services.Configuration.OptionsConfigurer`

### Example

Here is an example of a mutator that generates mutations of items similarly to the original enchantment system.

[!code-csharp[](../../Chaos/Scripting/ItemScripts/Enchantments/MagicPrefixScript.cs)]

This mutator is then added to the `MetaDataStoreOptions` in `Chaos.Services.Configuration.OptionsConfigurer`

[!code-csharp[](../../Chaos/Services/Configuration/OptionsConfigurer.cs#L59-65)]

> [!NOTE]
> You can have both Prefix and Suffix mutators. When metadata is generated, it will create a cross product of all prefix
> and suffix mutations

## Item MetaData

Item metadata is shown when a player hovers over an item in a shop or the bank. Item metadata is pulled from the details
in the `ItemTemplate`s that you have already created.

### Item MetaData Mapping

| Meta Property | ItemTemplate Property | Notes                                                                                                      |

| Level         | Level                 | The level required to equip the item<br/> If no level is specified, metadata is displayed as "no limit"    |
| Class         | Class                 | The class required to equip the item<br/> If no class is specified, metadata is displayed as "all classes" |
| Weight        | Weight                | The weight of the item                                                                                     |

| Description   | Description           | A short description of the item. This will show under "Features" in shop and bank windows                  |

## Ability MetaData

Ability metadata is shown per-class in the character's profile under the `Skills` tab. Ability metadata is pulled from
the details in the `SkillTemplates` and `SpellTemplates` that you have already created. Each `SClass` metadata file is
for a specific class. They follow the pattern laid out in the [Class](<xref:Chaos.DarkAges.Definitions.BaseClass>)
enum.For example, the `SClass1` metadata file is for the Warrior class.The `SClass2` metadata file is for the Rogue
class.

## Light MetaData

Light metadata controls the "Light" on maps that are specified within it. Within this metadata you can specify different
colors of light, the hours associated with them, and the enum value used to activate it.

### Lights.json Mapping

| Meta Property | Notes                                                                                                                        |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LightTypeName | The name of the light type. This name will be specified on map templates to allow them to use this light type                |
| EnumValue     | The numeric value of the [LightLevel](<xref:Chaos.DarkAges.Definitions.LightLevel>) enum that will activate this light color |
| StartHour     | The hour that the light starts (this would be used to update the ingame clock, but there isn't one anymore)                  |
| EndHour       | The hour that the light ends (this would be used to update the ingame clock, but there isn't one anymore)                    |
| Alpha         | The value of the alpha channel for the color of the light. Acceptable values are 0-32, where 32 is fully transparent         |
| Red           | The value of the red channel for the color of the light. Acceptable values are 0-255, where 255 is fully red                 |
| Green         | The value of the green channel for the color of the light. Acceptable values are 0-255, where 255 is fully green             |
| Blue          | The value of the blue channel for the color of the light. Acceptable values are 0-255, where 255 is fully blue               |

Lights.json defines light types and the enum value to activate them, but you must also specify what light type to use
for each map that you want light levels to be on. You do this by setting the `LightType` property on the map template.

### Example json

This example json defines 6 different colors for the `default` light type. This light type has been added on a number of
the default maps that come with the server. You can experiment with them by using the `/setlightlevel <lightlevel>`
command while on the map.

This example also defines 6 different colors for `bloodmoon` light type, just as another example of what you can do.

[!code-json[](../../Data/Configuration/MetaData/Lights.json)]

## Event MetaData

Event metadata appears in the character's profile under the `Events` tab. It is a list of events a player can complete,
along with details about those events. These events can be in one of 3 states: unavailable, available, or completed.
Here are the requirements for an event to be in each state:

### Unavailable (gray with a crossed out circle)

* The criteria for available are not met
* If the character is a master, all events before circle 6 will be unavailable
* If the character has an Advanced Class, all events before circle 7 will be unavailable

### Available (blue with an exclamation mark)

* The character must be at a level within the designated Circle (
  see [LevelCircle](<xref:Chaos.DarkAges.Definitions.LevelCircle>))
* The character must be one of the classes the quest is available to

### Completed (green check mark)

* The character must have a legend mark with a key equal to the id of the event

Since no objects directly correlate to events, the metadata must be specified directly
through [EventMetaSchema](<xref:Chaos.Schemas.MetaData.EventMetaSchema>).

This file is located at `StagingDir/MetaData/Events.json` by default

### Example json

[!code-json[](../../Data/Configuration/MetaData/Events.json)]

## Nation Description MetaData

Nation description metadata is used to display the description of a nation in the character's profile.
the [Nation](<xref:Chaos.DarkAges.Definitions.Nation>) enum technically only controls the emblem that is displayed on
the profile. The words next to it are controlled by the nation description metadata. This metadata is automatically
generated from the [Nation](<xref:Chaos.DarkAges.Definitions.Nation>) enum.

### Nation MetaData Mapping

The nation enum is mapped by it's number and name. For example, `Nation.Suomi` is mapped so that the description of the
emblem for that number is "Suomi".

## Mundane Illustration MetaData

Mundane illustration metadata is used by the client to determine which full art illustrations to display for mundanes,
if any. This metadata must be specified directly
through [MundaneIllustrationMetaSchema](<xref:Chaos.Schemas.MetaData.MundaneIllustrationMetaSchema>).

This file is located at `StagingDir/MetaData/MundaneIllustrations.json` by default

See [below](#illustrations) for a list of possible illustrations
