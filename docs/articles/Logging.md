# Logging

## Logging Providers

Chaos utilizes the [NLog logging framework](https://nlog-project.org/) to provide a robust logging system. The default
configuration is set to log concise and simplified messages to the console, with more detailed information being logged
to a file using structured logging.
This can be changed by modifying the `appsettings.logging.json` file. Continue reading to learn how to enable another
built in log target.

Chaos makes great use of object destructuring, combined with NLogs object transformers. If there is a desire to swap the
logging provider to something like [Serilog](https://serilog.net/), you will need to replace this behavior with
the `.Destructure.ByTransforming<T>`feature in `Program.cs`. You will also need to find a suitable replacement for
the [LogEvent](<xref:Chaos.NLog.Logging.LogEvent>) class.

This structured/destructured style of logging data can be more easily viewed via logging tools
like [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) or [Seq](https://datalust.co/seq).

## Seq

Seq is by far the simpler of these two tools, and due to this there is a built in way to enable logging to it.  
To quickly and easily enable Seq, set the configuration value `Logging:UseSeq` to `true`, and enter the details of
your Seq instance in the `appsettings.seq.json` files. They are preconfigured to use the default values for a local Seq
instance.

There is also a tool in this repo that can be used to configure seq for use with chaos-server. Look for
Tools\SeqConfigurator. Simply replace the hostname and apikey at the top of `Program.cs` and run the tool. It will add a
dashboard and signals related to logging topics.

## ElasticSearch

While the ELK stack(ElasticSearch, LogStash, Kibana) will be the more familiar tool to experienced developers, it can be
difficult for the less experienced to setup and configure. For this reason, if you want to use the ELK stack in chaos,
you will need to set it up yourself.
