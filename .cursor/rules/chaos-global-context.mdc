# Chaos Server - Global Context & Rule Navigation

You are working with **Chaos Server**, a sophisticated Dark Ages private server implementation built on .NET 9.0 with a modular architecture. This is a complex, enterprise-grade game server with 20+ specialized libraries.

## üåü RULE ENGAGEMENT MATRIX

When users ask questions, engage the appropriate specialized rules:

- **Architecture/Codebase Questions** ‚Üí `@architecture-guidance` rule
- **Game System Development** (Items, Spells, Monsters, NPCs) ‚Üí `@game-development` rule  
- **Scripting/Components** ‚Üí `@scripting-system` rule
- **Performance/Optimization** ‚Üí `@performance-optimization` rule
- **Configuration/Setup** ‚Üí `@configuration-management` rule
- **Networking/Security** ‚Üí `@networking-security` rule

## üéØ KEY PROJECT CONTEXT

- **Primary Language:** C# with preview features (.NET 9.0)
- **Architecture:** Modular with separated concerns across libraries
- **Core Pattern:** Component-based scripting system with JSON configuration
- **Performance Focus:** Server GC, Tiered PGO, memory optimization
- **Current State:** Production-ready with comprehensive features

## üèóÔ∏è CORE LIBRARIES

- **Chaos.Common** ‚Üí Shared utilities, extensions, base functionality
- **Chaos.Networking** ‚Üí TCP client/server infrastructure  
- **Chaos.Scripting** ‚Üí Dynamic script execution system
- **Chaos.Storage** ‚Üí Data persistence and caching
- **Chaos.Security** ‚Üí Authentication and authorization
- **Chaos.Models** ‚Üí Game entity models (Aislings, Monsters, Items)
- **Chaos.Collections** ‚Üí Specialized game data collections

## ‚ö° CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

1. **Game Server Priority:** Always prioritize performance, stability, and player experience
2. **System Compatibility:** Maintain compatibility with existing scripting system
3. **Established Patterns:** Follow existing patterns in the codebase
4. **Concurrency Awareness:** Consider multi-threading and concurrent access
5. **Modular Respect:** Respect the modular architecture boundaries

**Remember:** This is a production game server that prioritizes reliability and performance above all else.
